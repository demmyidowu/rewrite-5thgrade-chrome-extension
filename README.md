# Simplify Text - 5th Grade Level Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that rewrites selected text to a 5th grade reading level using OpenAI's API, making complex content more accessible and easier to understand.

## Features

- **Text Simplification**: Converts complex text to 5th grade reading level
- **Context Menu Integration**: Right-click any selected text to simplify it
- **Overlay Display**: Shows simplified text in a clean modal overlay
- **Original Text Access**: View the original text alongside the simplified version
- **Secure API Key Storage**: Safely stores your OpenAI API key using Chrome's sync storage
- **Works Everywhere**: Functions on any website

## Installation

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory
5. The extension will appear in your toolbar

## Setup

1. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. Enter your OpenAI API key in the settings popup
3. Click "Save" to store your API key securely

### Getting an OpenAI API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to the API keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key and paste it into the extension settings

## Usage

## How It Works

The extension uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to rewrite text at a 5th grade reading level. It:

1. Captures selected text through the context menu
2. Sends the text to OpenAI with a specific prompt to simplify language
3. Returns the simplified version while preserving the original meaning
4. Displays both versions in an easy-to-read format
